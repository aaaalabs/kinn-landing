## 🔤 TYPOGRAPHY / FONT PROMPTS

### Primary Typeface Direction
**Style:** BOLD Geometric Sans-Serif - "TYROL" Energy

**Core References:**
- **TYROL poster** - Extreme boldness, angular power, geometric strength
- **SILVAPLANA poster** - Art Deco elegance but still bold and confident

### KINN Wordmark Specifications

```
Ultra-bold geometric sans-serif display font for "KINN",
inspired by 1930s Austrian Alpine tourism poster lettering,
specifically: TYROL and SILVAPLANA poster typography,

CHARACTER DETAILS:

K: 
- Extremely thick vertical stem (stroke weight 1:3 ratio to letter height)
- Strong angular diagonal extending beyond the vertical
- Sharp 45-degree angles where diagonal meets stem
- Diagonal arm has slight upward momentum

I:
- Thick vertical rectangle, no serifs
- OR subtle geometric top/bottom caps (Art Deco detail)
- Same weight as K stem for consistency

N (first):
- Heavy vertical stems
- Diagonal connector bar at 45-degree angle
- Diagonal is slightly thinner than verticals (creates visual rhythm)
- Sharp, clean angle junctions

N (second):
- Mirror of first N
- OR diagonal extends slightly to connect with first N as design flourish
- Creates visual "NN" unit that suggests "Neural Network"

OVERALL CHARACTERISTICS:
- Stroke weight: BOLD - approximately 25-30% of letter height
- Letter spacing: Tight but not touching (90-95% normal tracking)
- Baseline: Solid, confident, stable
- Height: Tall and proud, slight condensation (95% width)
- Angles: Sharp, geometric, Art Deco precision
- Feel: CONFIDENT, STRONG, ALPINE MODERNISM
- No rounded corners - keep angles sharp and geometric
- Minimal stroke contrast - monoline or near-monoline weight
```

### Generation Prompt for AI/Designer:

```
Create a custom bold wordmark "KINN" in the style of 1930s Austrian Alpine tourism posters,
specifically inspired by the typography seen in "TYROL" vintage ski posters,
ultra-bold geometric sans-serif, angular Art Deco style,
extremely thick letterforms (25-30% stroke-to-height ratio),
sharp 45-degree angles, tight letter spacing,
confident and strong character, alpine modernism aesthetic,
monoline or minimal stroke variation,
letterforms should feel architectural and stable like mountain peaks,
color: deep mountain blue (#2C3E50) or copper orange (#B87333),
delivered as vector artwork, clean geometric shapes
```

### Alternate Generation Approach (Modification of Existing Font):

**Start with base font:**
- ITC Avant Garde Gothic (Extra Bold or Bold Condensed)
- Futura (Extra Bold)
- Neuzeit Grotesk (Bold)
- FF DIN (Black)

**Then modify:**
1. Increase stroke weight by 20-30%
2. Sharpen all rounded corners to geometric angles
3. Extend K diagonal slightly beyond baseline
4. Create custom connection between the two N's
5. Reduce letter spacing to 90-95%
6. Add subtle angular details at letter junctions

### Typography Color Applications

**Display/Headlines:**
- Primary: Deep Mountain Blue (#2C3E50) on Alpine White
- High Energy: Copper Orange (#B87333) on Deep Blue
- Reversed: Alpine White on Mountain Blue
- Accent: Neural Teal (#00D9FF) for select letters (like connecting the NNs)

**Never use:**
- Thin or light weights for "KINN" wordmark
- Rounded corners
- Soft or friendly typefaces
- Script or handwritten styles

## 💡 PROMPT ENGINEERING TIPS

**For Midjourney/DALL-E:**
- Always include: "Art Deco, vintage travel poster, limited color palette, geometric simplification, 1930s style"
- Add: "--no gradients, --no photorealistic, --no modern tech aesthetics"
- Use: "--ar 16:9" for banners, "--ar 1:1" for logos
- Include: "inspired by vintage Austrian and Swiss tourism posters"

**For Photoshop/Illustrator:**
- Use Pen Tool for clean geometric shapes
- Limit to 4-5 colors per composition
- Strong outlines (2-3px) on major elements
- Flat fills, avoid gradients unless extremely subtle
- Export with transparency for flexible backgrounds
